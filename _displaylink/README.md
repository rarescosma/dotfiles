To get DisplayLink working on Arch:
* Kernel version must be `4.5.x`
* Install `displaylink` from aur
* During the install edit `PKGBUILD` and paste in the contents on `PKGBUILD.displaylink`
* Enable the `displaylink` service: `sudo systemctl enable displaylink.service`
* Load the `udl` driver at boot: `echo udl | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/udl.conf`

As a status check for all the above you should see the DisplayLink output
in the list generated by `xrandr --listproviders`.

Next, edit `xrandr_setup.sh` and fill in the details of the DisplayLink device,
as well as the primary provider. Use `ePD1` for Dell XPS 13.
